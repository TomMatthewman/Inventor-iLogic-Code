# Inventor-iLogic-Code
A collection of iLogic VBA Code to reduce repetitive, mundane work in Autodesk Inventor. Ideal if you work with large sets of drawings as a draftsman, CAD Technician, or Design Engineer.
To Use said code in Inventor 2024, simply copy and paste each as a text file into a folder of your choosing. Open Inventor go to Tools, Options, iLogic Configuration, and set the DLLs directory to a file containing the txt documents. Once this is done head to Manage, Ilogic, and enable the ilogic browser this will create an Ilogic tab on the left of your screen, in this go to external rules and you should see your code. From here you can run the code or edit it in the integrated editor. I recommend leaving this illogic tab open for quick access to the simpler snippets for quick access, or set-up triggers.
For Batch exporting, You will require all drawings, assemblies, and parts to be in the same file. If working on a large scale you are unlikely to organize your designs in this way so may want to create a copy of all in a flat file (Be sure to also make a new project in Inventor to do this to avoid overriding existing content).
I do not have ownership over any of the code within this repository. I just know the hassle of trying to get a system like this to do what you want and the time it takes to go through countless forums to find what you need, especially in such an otherwise unused language, and fairly niche use case.
