# Inventor-iLogic-Code
A collection of iLogic VBA Code to reduce repetitive, mundane work in Autodesk Inventor. Ideal for if you work with large sets of drawings as a draftsmen, CAD Technician or Design Engineer.
To Use said code in Inventor 2024, simply copy and paste each as a text file into a folder of your choosing. Open Inventor and go to Tools, Options, iLogic Configeration and set the DLLs directory to file containing the txt documents. Once this is done then head to Manage, Ilogic and enable the ilogic browser this will create an ilogic tab on the left of your screen, in this go to external rules and you should see your code. From here you can run the code or edit it in the integrated editor. I recomend leaving this ilogic tab open for quick acsess for the simpler snippets for quick accsess, or set up triggers.
For Batch exporting You will require all drawings, assemblies and parts to be in the same file. If working on a large scale you are unlikly to organise your designs in this way so may want to create a copy of all in a flat file (Be sure to also make a new project in inventor to do this to avoid overiding existing content).
I do not have ownership over any of the code withing this repository. I just know the hassle of trying to get a system like this doing what you want and the time it take to go through countless forums to find what you need, esspicaly in such an otherwise unused langauge, and fairly niche use case.
